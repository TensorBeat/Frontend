# Tensorbeat Front End

## Instructions for use

After cloning the project, enter the project directory and run:

### `npm install`

For any additional package installations, use `npm ci <package name>`
instead of `npm i <package name>`. This is to prevent `package-lock.json`
from ruining git merges.

To start the application after this, simply run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in development mode. It may be viewed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To create an optimized production build, run:

### `npm run build`
